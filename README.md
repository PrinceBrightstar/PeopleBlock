WARNING: THIS FORK OF SPONSORBLOCK IS COMPLETELY UNDEVELOPED WITH NOTHING WORKING. I MAY NOT START WORKING ON IT FOR SOME TIME.
We are not affiliated with Sponsorblock in any way. We simply forked their project.



PeopleBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension built upon the base work done by Sponsorblock to skip segments featuring specific people in YouTube videos.  Users submit when a person is the main or one of the main focuses from the extension, and the extension automatically skips it. 

I have no idea what this is???? ((It also supports Invidious.))

ALL TEXT/LINKS/IMAGES BELOW THIS POINT ARE FROM THE ORIGINAL SPONSORBLOCK DESCRIPTION AND DO NOT REFLECT PEOPLEBLOCK.

# Server

The backend server code is available here: https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlockServer

To make sure that this project doesn't die, I have made the database publicly downloadable at https://sponsor.ajay.app/database ([License](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/wiki/Database-and-API-License)). If you are planning on using the database in another project, please read the [API Docs](https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/index.php/API_Docs) page for more information.

The dataset and API are now being used in some [ports](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/wiki/3rd-Party-Ports) as well as a [neural network](https://github.com/andrewzlee/NeuralBlock).

# API

You can read the API docs [here](https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/w/API_Docs).

# Building
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Credit

The awesome [Invidious API](https://docs.invidious.io/) was previously used, and the server is now using [NewLeaf](https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/NewLeaf) to get video info from YouTube.

Originally forked from [YTSponsorSkip](https://github.com/NDevTK/YTSponsorSkip), but very little code remains.
